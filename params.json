Primary scope of this project was the development of an automatic control system for agriculture application that would be controlled by the farmer using their mobile phone and the SMS service. By the way, an auxiliary system that configures and customizes the RCA system was development making it more flexible and more functional for a great variety of remote control applications. The central control unit that used for this project was the Q2687 of the Wavecom (now [Sierra Wireless](www.sierrawireless.com)) company over the Q26 development board. There were also many auxiliary electronic and electrical equipment for the simulation and the testing procedure.\r\n\r\nThe remote control and automatic control system application running over the central control unit is implemented in C programming language. The administrator can control the RCA system using commands sent in SMS text. He can also execute or schedule specific tasks. The RCA system can send reports for the status of multiple tasks if the administration asks for it. The RCA system executes automatically tasks when inputs values change according to the configuration the administrator has done.\r\n\r\nThe configuration and customization application is developed as a web application using PHP and HTML programming language. This application gets as inputs the number of inputs and outputs of the RCA system and some extra options and it creates the C code needed for building the RCA system software.\r\n\r\n###Documentation\r\n- [Diploma Thesis Documentation](https://github.com/pkalodimas/Diploma-Thesis/raw/master/Diploma%20Thesis%20-%20Kalodimas.pdf) (Greek language)\r\n- [Diploma Thesis Presentation](https://github.com/pkalodimas/Diploma-Thesis/raw/master/Diploma%20Thesis%20Presentation%20-%20Kalodimas.pdf) (English language)\r\n\r\n###Equipment\r\n- Wavecom Q2687 GSM Module (ARM936, 32bit)\r\n- Wavecom Q26 Series Development Kit\r\n\r\n###Tools\r\n- Open AT SDK\r\n- Eclipse\r\n- Apache Server\r\n\r\n###Other\r\n- **Programming languages:** C, PHP, HTML\r\n- **Fields:** Embedded Systems, Networking, M2M, Web Applications\r\n",
